# Todo List Desktop App

A very basic desktop application built with Electron which lets you save a list of tasks. These tasks can only be added, toggled completed or not, and deleted. No edition is supported in this version.

I made this application to learn how to use Electron and because I needed a very basic app to control the tasks I had left to do.

# Installation

As of now, the application does not support native installation. In order to run it, you must execute ```npm install``` to install all dependencies. Finally, run ```npm start``` to see the application in action.
